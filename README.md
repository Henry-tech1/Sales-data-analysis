FINDINGS
Computer accessories and Electonics categories are among the top selling products  in this category. According to my analysis, the top selling products should be prioritized for discounts as the discount percentages do not necessarily influence the customers to make purchases.
Based on the analysis,there is a very weak correlation between the discount percentage and the rating count. This is shown in that changes in the discount percentage do not strongly influence the rating count of the product.Therefore discounts alone might not significantly impact the number of ratings the  products receive.

Products offering large discounts may not necessarily generate more reviews, which could indicate that customers are either:
-Not satisfied with the products, even after a discount.
-Not motivated to leave reviews despite the discount.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Categories showing high discounts but low ratings may need to reassessed on basis of the product quality or marketing strategies. Additionally, they could benefit from improved customer support or extended warranties rather than relying solely on high discounts.

The focus should be on improving customer satisfaction and ensuring that customers feel the product quality aligns with the discounted price.

We could also encourage customer feedback after purchase for any categories where discounts are offered to gauge the sales
